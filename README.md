# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After spending over a decade working my way up to an architect position in the .NET world, I am now exploring and expanding my coding skills by blending my love of coding and cryptocurrencies.

## About me
 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**
- ðŸ”­ I just completed a 10 week Solidity bootcamp, **[Encode Solidity Bootcamp](https://www.encode.club/encode-bootcamp) by [Encode Club](https://www.encode.club/)**
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me learn **Solidity and front end frameworks**!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **learning more about blockchain development**
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [cmreynol@protonmail.com](cmreynol@protonmail.com)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy hands on coding so much that I quit my job as an architect to go back into a position as an engineer!
